ESTIMATE of time to complete assignment: 10 hours

Date  Started  Spent Work completed
----  -------  ----  --------------
9/27   9:00pm  3:00  Read assignment and looked up relevant functions 
					 in C in a Nutshell and lecture notes and coded for FILE I/O.
9/29   8:00pm  4:00  Finished reading in file and checking for argument validity.
					 Implemented -nearest.
10/02  9:00pm  3:30  Worked with ULAs to get a sense of insert nearest and farthest.
					 Implemented insert nearest, but was getting incorrect distance
					 and route.
10/03  2:30pm  2:00  Heavily debugged using gdb to find bugs in total distance, swapping
				     and reordering of the route. Validated the debugged insert nearest function with
					 few test cases.
10/03  8:30pm  2:00  Finished implementing insert farthest. Ran public tests to discover minor error
					 in implementation of nearest. Fixed bugs using gdb. Discussed more edge cases with ULAs.
					 Capped the number of characters fscanf was reading in to prevent seg fault.

I discussed my solution with: Just ULAs.

The most difficult part of this assigment was coming up with a list of auxiliary functions
and retroactively changing repeated code into separate functions. Nearest was rather easy
to implement but conceptualizing insert was extremely difficult from just reading the
specs on the class page. I had to get help from ULAs to correctly interpret the specifications
of the insert nearest and farthest functions. Also, I encountered faced difficulty from
a lot of bugs dealing with function inputs and keeping track of arrays. Using gdb was 
extremely helpful in pinpointing issues. I surprisingly spent a lot of time trying to 
figure out how to format my output to look exactly like the test cases.
