ESTIMATE of time to complete assignment: 10 hours

      Time     Time
Date  Started  Spent Work completed
----  -------  ----  --------------
9/12   4:00pm  0:30  read assignment and looked up relevant functions 
					 in C in a Nutshell and lecture notes.
9/14   10:00pm 2:30  wrote down potential state machine and implemented rough
					 versions of states FINDTRKPTSTART, FINDLAT, FINDLON, 
					 FINDELE, FINDTIME, FINDTRKPTEND.
9/15   6:30pm  3:30  Finalized states, bebugged and tested code to pass all public cases;
					 Spent one hour finding one line of code that was missing
					 which was messing with outputs. Worked with ULAs at office hours.
9/18   4:30pm  0:30  Fixed code to not parse for edge case when tag starts with lat but does
					 not follow with white space (ex. <latmon...).
9/18   7:45pm  2:00  Discussed more edge cases with ULAs. Replaced all checks for whitespace with
					 isspace(). Spent 1hr 30 min trying to alter state machine to take levels
					 and descendants into account. Finished writing log file.

I discussed my solution with: Just ULAs.

The most difficult part was coming up with the initial framework for my state machine.
After conceptualizing the overall framework, making sure that each specification was 
checked by my state machine was rather more time consuming than I thought. Checking
for edge cases were also extremely difficult. For each case my edge case did not pass,
I had to go back and alter my code which led to instances for which my code would break.
To deal with those bugs, I had to learn how to use "gdb" (thank you ULAs!) to put break 
points in my code and see what my code is doing at every step. I also spent a huge amount
of time getting used to the syntax of C which slowed down my overall process.
