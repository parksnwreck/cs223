I discussed my solution with: Josh Ip, Kevin Chen.

This assignment was definitely one of the smoothest of our homeworks. Once I conceptually understood graphs, I was easily able to implement
lugraph.c and bfs. The hardest part of the assignment was understanding the greedy algorithm. I initially started with an implementation 
with bubble sort and had to convert the algorithm to merge sort. After going through the algorithm with the ULAs, I had a fairly easy time
implementing the algorithm into TSP. I also spent more time than I thought converting all static allocation of memory to dynamic allocation.
Overall, the assignment was quite kind in terms of workload.
